# Java Examples

A comprehensive collection of Java examples.
Serves as a reference.

## Getting Started

You will need:

- JDK 21 or later (might work with earlier versions for some examples).
- IDE of your choice like IntelliJ IDEA.

## Running the Examples

The examples are in the form of JUnit tests (JUnit 5 to be specific).
Which are further divided into several packages, each focusing on different aspects.

Since running all the tests at once can be overwhelming,
it is recommended to run them individually within your IDE.
